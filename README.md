this repo contains many different versions of my camera app leading up to V5, the most recent version that is being submitted for testing and grading.

# What is it?

This camera app is exactly what it sounds like. it is an app that i created in a 1 month course using many different phone features like location and the camera, of course. My original goal for this app was to have it use AI to generate a recreation of the pictures taken but i was having a hard time getting the API to accept my requests for the file upload. other than that, this app does what i wanted, it takes pictures and allows you to view many things useful for photographers in real time all from one place
